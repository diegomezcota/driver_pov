## Objective

We want to emulate a car driving through a street with a point of view perspective,
where the street and trees are moving towards the driver.

## How to run driver_pov on your browser
1) If you don't have Node installed on your computer, downlaod it from https://nodejs.org and install it with the default options.
2) Install the http-server package from npm (node package manager) by running the command `npm install -g http-server` on your terminal.
3) On your terminal, change the path to the directory where you want to clone the driver_pov repository, and clone it.
4) On that same directory, and also on the terminal, run the command `http-server` to start the server.
5) Go to your favorite browser and look for "localhost:8080" on your browser's address bar.
6) Enjoy driver_pov!! To move the driving wheel use the left and right arrow keys, to speed the car use the up arrow key, and to slow down the car use the down arrow key.
